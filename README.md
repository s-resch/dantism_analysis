# Dantism Analysis

Repository containing scripts and material for an automatic dantism analysis as described in chapter 8.4 of Sascha Resch's doctoral thesis at LMU Munich

# Python scripts

In this repository you find the Python scripts used to extract the dantisms from Machiavelli's terzarima texts. Also you find a script that was written to transform Machiavelli's Capitolo Pastorale from a raw textual representation into TEI XML-format used to run the dantism analysis

# Textual corpus

Due to copyright Machiavelli's terzarima texts can't be published here. We used the texts available at Biblioteca Italiana (http://www.bibliotecaitaliana.it/) respecitvely for Capitolo Pastorale the text available in: Niccolò Machiavelli. Tutte le opere.
Secondo l’edizione di Mario Martelli (1971), hg. von Pier Davide Accendere, Mailand, S. 2500–2504.

# Dantism list

Due to copyright the lists of dantisms used to run the dantism analysis can't be published here. The lists are based on the list of hapax and prime attestazioni in Dante's Commedia established by Riccardo Viel (VIEL, Riccardo 2018: ‚Quella materia ond’io son fatto scriba‘. Hapax e prime attestazioni della Commedia, Lecce/Rovato.). In the appendix of Sascha Resch's doctoral thesis you can find detailed information about the differences between Viel's word list and the dantism list built using Viel's results. Thus, the dantism list used can be easily reconstructed

# Results

You can find the results of the analysis performed in the `Results` folder, there you find the XML-result files. Furthermore, you find an XSD-file which defines the structure of the XML-result files
